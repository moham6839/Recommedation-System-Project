# Recommedation-System-Project

# Overview

With streaming services more popular now than ever before, there are an extensive catalog of movies that users may find to be overwhelming. For this reason, a recommendation system is helpful to organize and steamline recommended movies based on ratings users provide. As a startup, it is essential to establish a recommendation system that helps current and future users to navigate the collection of movies in the streaming service and caters to their interests based on how they rate movies they have watched. This project will illustrate the mechanics of a recommendation system and why it is important for creating a streaming service. 

# Data Source

The data used for this project comes from a dataset called MovieLens, which contains data on links, tags, ratings and movies. For purposes of this project I will focus on ratings and movies.
